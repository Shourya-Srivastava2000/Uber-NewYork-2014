This repo contains the R code to craft data visualizations and
the visualizations themselves. I used the Uber Dataset for pickups in
New York City in 2014.

I have come up with a variety of visualizations, based on bases throughout the city
as designated by Uber, the number of trips, time, day, month, and pickup locations.



Note: I have taken assistance from an external website, data flair training.
